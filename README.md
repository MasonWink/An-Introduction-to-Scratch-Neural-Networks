Hello! I made this repo to not only help others understand basic neural networks, but also to act as a reference for my future self. 
This repo was specifically written to be digestible and full of comments outlining how a neural network functions while giving plenty of insight into why each implementation decision was made.
The guide should be followed in the order of:
- Layer
- Dense
- Activation
- hyperbolicTangent
- meanSquare
- XOR

There're also two math files containing images that walkthrough the math necessary to find any calculated variable.
Despite this, it's recommended that you're familiar some topics in Calc III, basic python and numpy, and have some familiarity with matrices.

If you have any suggestions, feel free to let me know!
Thank you!
